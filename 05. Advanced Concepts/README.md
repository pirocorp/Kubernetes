# Manifest files explanations (YAML)

## Part 1

### Static pod

- Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet
- The spec of a static Pod cannot refer to other API objects
- Their manifests are standard but are stored in a specific folder on controle plane node
- Usually, this is /etc/kubernetes/manifests
- And it is regulated by the kublet configuration file


```yaml
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: static-pod
  labels:
    app: static-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: alpine
    name: main
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["1d"]
```

### Sidecar (Pattern)

Sidecar containers enhance the main container. For example, it may sync the local file system with a remote repository. In any case, both share the same filesystem.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sidecar
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels: 
      app: sidecar
  minReadySeconds: 15
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sidecar
    spec:
      containers:
      # First container
      - name: cont-main
        image: shekeriev/k8s-appb
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        # Same volume is mounted in both containers, but on a different path
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /var/www/html/data
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 
      # Second container
      - name: cont-sidecar
        image: alpine
        # Same volume is mounted in both containers, but on a different path
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - while true; do
              date >> /data/generated-data.txt;
              sleep 10;
            done
      volumes:
      - name: data
        emptyDir: {}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sidecar
  labels:
    app: sidecar
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    nodePort: 30001
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: sidecar
```

### Adapter (Pattern)

Adapter containers are used to standardize and normalize the output
