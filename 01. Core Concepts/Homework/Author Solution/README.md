# Task 1

Execute a series of commands to
1. Create a namespace named homework
2. Create a homework-1 pod in that namespace that uses this (shekeriev/k8s-oracle) image and set two labels on it (all at once) - app=hw and tier=gold
3. Remove the tier=gold label with a separate command
4. Create a homework-2 pod in that namespace that uses this (shekeriev/k8s-oracle) image
5. Add a label to the second pod app=hw with a separate command
6. Set annotation on both pods with the following content purpose=homework
7. Create a homerwork-svc service to expose both pods on port 32000 of every node in the cluster

Solution:

1. To create the required namespace execute
```bash
kubectl create namespace homework
```
2. Then create the first pod with
```bash
kubectl run homework-1 --image=shekeriev/k8s-oracle --labels=app=hw,tier=gold --namespace homework
```
3. We can remove the extra label with
```bash
kubectl label pods homework-1 tier- --namespace homework
```
4. Create the second pod
```bash
kubectl run homework-2 --image=shekeriev/k8s-oracle --namespace homework
```
5. We can add label at any time with
```bash
kubectl label pods homework-2 app=hw --namespace homework
```
6. Annotations are handled with a separate command. This one, we can execute it in two steps
```bash
kubectl annotate pods homework-1 purpose=homework --namespace homework
kubectl annotate pods homework-2 purpose=homework --namespace homework
```
Or in just one (by using selectors)

```bash
kubectl annotate pods purpose=homework --namespace homework --selector=app=hw
```
7. Creating a service can be achieved both via the expose and the create commands. However, they have different set of parameters. For this task, we must use the create command
```bash
kubectl create service nodeport homework-svc --node-port=32000 --tcp=5000:5000 --namespace homework
```
If we try now to access the application, we will notice that it wonâ€™t show. Should we want to know why, we can describe the service and notice that no pods are being associated (the **endpoints** list is empty). We can handle this by changing the automatically created selector (**app=homework-svc**) of the service with something more suitable (**app=hw**) that will select the two pods
```bash
kubectl set selector service homework-svc app=hw --namespace homework
```

## Task 2

Create manifests for every object (the namespace, the two pods, and the service) from task 1 and apply them one by one

Solution:

hw-ns.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: homework
```
hw-pod-1.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    purpose: homework
  labels:
    app: hw
  name: homework-1
  namespace: homework
spec:
  containers:
  - image: shekeriev/k8s-oracle
    name: homework-1
```

hw-pod-2.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    purpose: homework
  labels:
    app: hw
  name: homework-2
  namespace: homework
spec:
  containers:
  - image: shekeriev/k8s-oracle
    name: homework-2
```

kubectl apply -f hw-svc.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hw
  name: homework-svc
  namespace: homework
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 5000-5000
    nodePort: 32000
    port: 5000
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: hw
  type: NodePort
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f hw-ns.yaml
kubectl apply -f hw-pod-1.yaml
kubectl apply -f hw-pod-2.yaml
kubectl apply -f hw-svc.yaml
```

## Task 3

Is there a way to submit those manifests at once? Find and demonstrate two ways of doing it

Solution:

Under Windows

```cmd
kubectl apply -R -f .\task2\
```

Or the following under UNIX-like OSes

```bash
kubectl apply -R -f task2/
```

## Task 4

Try to translate the attached ```docker-compose.yml``` file to a set of Kubernetes objects and the corresponding manifest(s)

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  listener:
    image: "shekeriev/k8s-listener"
  speaker:
    image: "shekeriev/k8s-speaker"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hw
    role: listener
  name: listener
spec:
  containers:
  - image: shekeriev/k8s-listener
    name: listener
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hw
    role: speaker
  name: speaker
spec:
  containers:
  - image: shekeriev/k8s-speaker
    name: speaker
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hw
  name: listener
spec:
  ports:
  - name: listener-port
    nodePort: 32000
    port: 5000
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: hw
    role: listener
  type: NodePort
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hw
  name: speaker
spec:
  ports:
  - name: speaker-port
    port: 5000
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5000
  selector:
    app: hw
    role: speaker
```
