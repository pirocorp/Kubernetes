# Task 1

Execute a series of commands to
1. Create a namespace named homework
2. Create a homework-1 pod in that namespace that uses this (shekeriev/k8s-oracle) image and set two labels on it (all at once) - app=hw and tier=gold
3. Remove the tier=gold label with a separate command
4. Create a homework-2 pod in that namespace that uses this (shekeriev/k8s-oracle) image
5. Add a label to the second pod app=hw with a separate command
6. Set annotation on both pods with the following content purpose=homework
7. Create a homerwork-svc service to expose both pods on port 32000 of every node in the cluster

Solution:

We assume that all we are working on a machine with minikube installed and running. Open a terminal session and make sure that your cluster is ready and reachable

1. To create the required namespace execute
```bash
kubectl create namespace homework
```
2. Then create the first pod with
```bash
kubectl run homework-1 --image=shekeriev/k8s-oracle --labels=app=hw,tier=gold --namespace homework
```
3. We can remove the extra label with
```bash
kubectl label pods homework-1 tier- --namespace homework
```
4. Create the second pod
```bash
kubectl run homework-2 --image=shekeriev/k8s-oracle --namespace homework
```
5. We can add label at any time with
```bash
kubectl label pods homework-2 app=hw --namespace homework
```
6. Annotations are handled with a separate command. This one, we can execute it in two steps
```bash
kubectl annotate pods homework-1 purpose=homework --namespace homework
kubectl annotate pods homework-2 purpose=homework --namespace homework
```
Or in just one (by using selectors)

```bash
kubectl annotate pods purpose=homework --namespace homework --selector=app=hw
```
7. Creating a service can be achieved both via the expose and the create commands. However, they have different set of parameters. For this task, we must use the create command
```bash
kubectl create service nodeport homework-svc --node-port=32000 --tcp=5000:5000 --namespace homework
```
If we try now to access the application, we will notice that it wonâ€™t show. Should we want to know why, we can describe the service and notice that no pods are being associated (the **endpoints** list is empty). We can handle this by changing the automatically created selector (**app=homework-svc**) of the service with something more suitable (**app=hw**) that will select the two pods
```bash
kubectl set selector service homework-svc app=hw --namespace homework
```
